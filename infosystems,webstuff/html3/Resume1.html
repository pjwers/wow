        <h3 class="justify"><span class="bold">Personal and Professional Background</span> </h3>Personal and Professional Background</h3>
        <p justify> My name is Jackson, and I am a driven, determined individual with a strong work ethic. I am from Bountiful,
            Utah, and throughout my career, I have accumulated a wide range of experiences in various job fields. These
            roles have not only enhanced my skills but have also shaped my approach to work, allowing me to excel in
            environments that demand dedication and adaptability. My diverse professional background has provided me with a
            deep understanding of the value of hard work, teamwork, and customer service, all of which I aim to apply to new
            opportunities.</p>
    
        <h3>Drive and Determination</h3>
        <p justify>One of my defining qualities is my relentless drive to succeed. In every job I have held, I have always strived
            for excellence, setting high standards for myself and working diligently to meet them. This drive has propelled
            me forward, enabling me to take on new challenges, learn new skills, and consistently exceed expectations.
            Whether it was managing a busy work schedule, learning a new skill on the job, or stepping up when needed, I
            have always embraced challenges with enthusiasm and commitment.</p>
    
        <h3>Mission Experience and Language Skills</h3>
        <img src="../images4/OIP (1).jpg" height="200" alt="picture of chile">
        <p justify> I recently returned from a two-year mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, where I had the
            opportunity to serve in a Spanish-speaking community. This mission allowed me to further develop my leadership
            skills, interpersonal abilities, and adaptability in a dynamic environment. It also gave me the chance to master
            the Spanish language, a skill I continue to cultivate. My mission experience has given me valuable insights into
            communication, relationship-building, and problem-solving, all of which will serve me well in any professional
            setting.</p>
    
        <img src="../images4/OIP.jpg" height="150" alt="picture of chile">
        <h3>Current Career Goals and Pursuits</h3>
        <p justify>As I look ahead to the future, I am focused on advancing my career in the real estate industry. I am currently
            working towards obtaining my real estate license, and I am excited about the opportunities this will open up for
            me. Real estate combines my passion for helping others with my interest in finance and property management. I am
            committed to staying current with industry trends and continually developing my knowledge, ensuring that I can
            offer valuable insights to clients and colleagues alike</p>
    
        <h3>Academic Pursuits and Future Ambitions</h3>
        <img src="../images4/download.jpg" height="200" alt="picture of jackson">
        <p justify>In addition to my real estate goals, I am also preparing to major in Business Management and Finance. This
            academic pursuit will provide me with the foundational knowledge I need to further my career and take on
            leadership roles. I am eager to learn about business operations, financial strategies, and management principles
            to become an effective and knowledgeable professional in my chosen field. By combining my real estate
            aspirations with a strong academic foundation, I plan to build a successful and fulfilling career in business
            and finance.</p>
    
        <h3>Commitment to Professional Growth</h3>
        <p .justify> I believe that learning is a lifelong process, and I am committed to continually growing both professionally and
            personally. Whether through formal education, hands-on experience, or self-study, I am always looking for ways
            to expand my skill set and enhance my capabilities. I am particularly focused on developing expertise in the
            areas of business management and finance, as I know these will be key to achieving long-term success. My goal is
            to be a well-rounded, knowledgeable professional who can bring value to any organization I work with.</p>
    
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p .justify> In summary, I am a dedicated and goal-oriented individual with a diverse professional background and a strong
            drive for success. My experiences, including my mission service and my pursuit of a real estate license, have
            shaped me into someone who is passionate about personal growth, service, and making meaningful contributions. As
            I continue my academic journey and work towards my career goals, I am excited about the future and the
            opportunities that lie ahead. I am confident that my drive, determination, and commitment to excellence will
            allow me to thrive in any professional setting and contribute to the success of any team or organization I am a
            part of.</p>
